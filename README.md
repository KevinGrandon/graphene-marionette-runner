# Graphene Marionette Test Runner

The idea is that this would be a library which would allow us to run Marionette tests against the Graphene runtime.

### Specifying a binary

Specify a binary by linking it to `binary_link` in the root of the checkout. Something like:

```
# An example of linking on MacOS:
ln -s ~/Downloads/Horizon.app binary_link
```
